During Misinfo Conference we used Mockingbird to create wireframes of the Lesson 1, Legit-o-Meter activity.

Here is a link to the [mockingbird project](https://gomockingbird.com/projects/1ai9dty/4gXVnC).

- [x] Teacher - Dashboard
      - This is the landing page once authed. Teachers manage their "Games" and start new "Games" 
      - A "Game" instance is created once the teacher clicks "Start a new game". The Game instance is assigned to the Teacher's User
      - A teacher can click on the name of an exisiting game. This takes them to a Game Summary page which is similar to a "Start Your Game Page". From there you can edit the name or unpublish.

- [x] Teacher - Choose a Theme 
      - Teacher can select from pre-populated Themes for their Game, or create their own new Theme
      - Edit themes a teacher has already created
      - Selecting a theme associated a Theme ID to the Game instance
      - Post-MVP idea: Allow teachers to modify pre-populated themes, creating a copy instance.
      - Post-MVP idea: See & Copy other teachers collections

- [x] Teacher - Create a Theme/Collection
      - Teacher is required to name a Theme
      - *Collection might be a better word than Theme for this object*
      - Add collections of articles. They input a URL. Our system dectects a headline from the HTML meta data. Headline does not need to be editable.
      - Teacher selects Article Type from select/dropdown
        - [ ] List of Article Type Options
        - [ ] Definitions for both Teachers and students of article types
      - Teacher can delete a theme
      - As a teacher adds articles, the form auto-saves.
      - Post-MVP idea: Include a guide for how to create a Theme. Suggest teachers to things like include articles from various sources. Give them recommendations on where to find misinformative articles.

- [x] Teacher - Start a Game
      -  Review step, see all the articles
      - Choose to publish, which creates a public URL for the teacher to share with students. Public URL looks like "domain.com/teacher_username/game_id"
      - The Game instance is given a name attribute. 
      - The only thing editable on this page is the Game Name.
        - Question: Is there a default name?
      - Post MVP question: Should teachers be able to select which articles within a Theme/Collection they want to use within a given game

- [x] Teacher - Review Student Ratings
      - A teacher can review students' article evaluations. Students appear in a list.
      - On this page a teacher can 
        - rename the the Game 
        - change the publish state of the Game back to draft mode, disabiling the public URL

- [ ] Teacher - Review Specific Student Evaluation
      - A teacher sees read only version of the student evaluation page. 
      
- [x] Student - Evaluate an Article
      - Form with all the questions a student can respond to. Broken into two main sections
        - Reflect on the crediblity of the article
        - Rate the credibility of this article
      - [ ] Update language from Sarah's worksheet draft
      - [ ] Evaluate usability of layout and iterate, maybe a more high-fi mockup is needed
      - Question: Should we provide students real time feedback on how their rating is being calculated so that they aren't suprised when a numerical rating appears on the next page?

- [x] Student - Success
      - a student sees their article rating
      - a student sees the average rating that others gave the article. This might require a minimum number of ratings on an article before it appears.

**General UX Questions:**
- Do we need better navigational options
  - Breadcrumbs? Menu? etc?
- How can a student revisit their work if we don't create user accounts?
- Do teachers need the option for a drafted state. Would students need to do this outside of classtime? 

**Legal question:**
- Can a public domain reference a student's first name, last initial?
