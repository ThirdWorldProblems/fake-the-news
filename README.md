Project Purpose: To promote an awareness of internet health by fostering learnersâ€™ web literacy, this grant is supporting the development of three interactive web literacy lessons and web apps to facilitate learning.

_These are all working titles_

### Lesson #1: Legit-o-Meter

The goal of Lesson 1 is to give students the tools to examine a web article's credibility. The Fake the News team will develop a web app version of the [Kraken the Code Web Literacy Exercise](https://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/WebLiteracyBasics-I/session01-kraken.html).

### Lesson #2: Rewriting History

The goal of Lesson 2 is to help students understand the origins and consequences of fake news using historical examples. By the end of the lesson, they will understand what motivates this ecosystem and how money, propoganda, misinformation, and political bias influence the content we see online.

### Lesson #3: Run the Presses

The goal of the Lesson 3 is to put students in the seat of the important roles at a news publishing organization. As a journalist, what goes into writing and article? As an Editor, what articles do you choose run with and why?
